    I am a full-stack developer. I have a strong background as a software architect 
    and have successfully led teams. I create fast, clean, and maintainable 
    web applications, ready to scale from few users to thousands. I can help you deliver a seamless and 
    engaging experience to your users. Background in computer science and ability as a full-stack developer 
    (front-end and back-end) allow me to create everything from small business websites to custom web applications.

    For this example i don't use Vue or React because the server not compatible with ssh, so I decide use all functions in manual with javascript, always given the sensation of reactive data information.
